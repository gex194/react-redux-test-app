# react-redux-test-app
test application for educational purposes

Basically, this is just a SPA that fetches music data like albums, tracklists, number of songs. I used musicbrainz.org API, but it's not perfect and i'm going to rewrite this with Spotify API in near future. For now, just some bare-bones functionality.

Used:
- React
- ReactDOM
- Redux
- axios
- Redux logger middleware
- Redux-thunk middleware
- Styled-components
